2. IDENTIFY Christ's presence using three modes:

   - MODE 3: THEMATIC (Themes that find ultimate fulfillment in Christ)
3. NAME Christ's title/role in this chapter
4. STATE Christ's action/accomplishment

### MATH - Mathematics Room

**Core Question:** Which time prophecy does this passage fulfill, foreshadow, or connect to, and how does it reveal God's precise timing in redemptive history?
**METHOD:**
1. REVIEW THE SIX TIME PROPHECIES:
   - @120: Noah's 120-year warning before Flood (Genesis 6:3)
   - @400: Israel's 400-year Egyptian captivity (Genesis 15:13)
   - @70y: 70-year Babylonian exile (Jeremiah 25:11-12, 29:10)
   - @490: 70-weeks prophecy/Messiah's timeline (Daniel 9:24-27, 457 BC to AD 34)
   - @1260: 1260-year papal persecution period (Daniel 7:25, Revelation 11-13, AD 538-1798)
   - @2300: 2300-year sanctuary cleansing/investigative judgment (Daniel 8:14, 457 BC to AD 1844)
2. IDENTIFY which time prophecy your passage connects to
3. STATE the connection: Which prophecy? What's the timeframe? How is it fulfilled?
4. CALCULATE if necessary (especially @490 and @2300 starting from 457 BC decree)
5. EXTRACT theological lesson: What does this timeline reveal about God's sovereignty?

**Example:** Daniel 9:25 connects to @490 • 457 BC + 483 years = AD 27 • Jesus baptized exactly on prophetic schedule • Lesson: Messiah arrived precisely when predicted

## COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID

### ❌ WRONG: Using Bible Freestyle (BF) for philosophical analysis
**Correct:** BF is for listing verse relatives: "John 3:16 → Rom 5:8, 1 John 4:9-10"
**Wrong:** Writing paragraphs about flesh vs spirit without verse links

### ❌ WRONG: Using Connect-6 (C6) with the 6 themes
**Correct:** C6 is about genre: Prophecy/Parable/Epistle/History/Gospel/Poetry
**Wrong:** "C6: 1. Life of Christ Wall 2. Sanctuary Wall..." (those are Theme Room themes!)

### ❌ WRONG: Inventing new room names or methodologies
**Correct:** Only use rooms listed in this schema with their exact methods
**Wrong:** Creating "Spiritual Warfare Room" or "Apologetics Room" that don't exist

### ❌ WRONG: Mixing up room purposes
**Correct:** Each room has ONE specific purpose and method
**Wrong:** Using Story Room to analyze symbols (that's Symbols Room)

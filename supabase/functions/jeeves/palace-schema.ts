## FLOOR 1: FURNISHING (Memory & Visualization)

### SR - Story Room
**Purpose:** Transform Bible events into memorable 3-7 beat sequences
**Core Question:** What exactly happened—and in what order?
**METHOD:** Break each story into 3–7 'beats' (film shots). Name each beat with a punchy noun/verb.
**Example:** Joseph: Coat → Pit → Caravan → Prison → Palace

### IR - Imagination Room  
**Purpose:** Experience Scripture with your whole being through sanctified imagination
**Core Question:** What does it feel like to stand there?
**METHOD:** Use your imagination to step fully into the biblical scene. Engage all five senses: What do you see, hear, touch, smell, and taste? Let the passage become a lived experience, not just information. Then capture in one sentence how this sensory encounter resonates with your own story.

### 24 - 24FPS Room
**Purpose:** Index every chapter with a single sticky image
**Core Question:** What image will make this chapter unforgettably findable?
**METHOD:** Choose a striking, even quirky icon per chapter (not artful—memorable).

### BR - Bible Rendered
**Purpose:** Compress the Bible into ~51 macro-frames
**Core Question:** What block image captures this 24-chapter arc?
**METHOD:** Assign a symbolic glyph to each block (/, ×, crown, tear, etc.).

### TR - Translation Room
**Purpose:** Turn abstractions into concrete visuals
**Core Question:** What does this verse look like?
**METHOD:** Verse → icon; pericope → 3-panel comic; book → mural.

### GR - Gems Room
**Purpose:** Mine Scripture for rare truths by combining 2-4 unrelated texts
**Core Question:** What beautiful truth emerges when I combine these seemingly unrelated texts?
**METHOD:** Take 2-4 verses from different books/contexts; place them side by side; identify the rare truth that emerges from their combination.
**Example:** Ex 12 (Passover at twilight) + Jn 19:14 (crucifixion at 6th hour) → Jesus died at exact moment Passover lambs were slain

---

## FLOOR 2: INVESTIGATION (Detective Work)

**Core Question:** What did the words mean then, and what did the world look like there?
**METHOD:** 3–5 terms to define; 1–2 cultural notes; 2–3 commentary excerpts (label source).

### ST - Symbols/Types Room
**Purpose:** Build God's symbol dictionary and Christ-types
**Core Question:** What is this symbol's consistent meaning and Christ-fulfillment?
**METHOD:** Symbol card: sign → scope → Christ locus → texts.
**Examples:** Lamb, Rock, Light, Water, Bread, Temple

### QR - Questions Room
**Purpose:** Interrogate the text until the shape of truth appears
**Core Question:** What must be asked inside the text, across texts, and in PT-framework?
**METHOD:** 25 intra + 25 inter + 25 PT (75x3 when fully trained).

### QA - Q&A Chains Room
**Purpose:** Let Scripture answer Scripture
**Core Question:** Where does the Bible itself supply the answer?
**METHOD:** For each key question, cite 2–4 cross-texts that resolve it.

**Core Question:** What verses are this verse's 'relatives'?
**METHOD:** Pick a verse; name 3–5 'relatives' (brothers/cousins).

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** This room is about LISTING RELATED VERSES, not philosophical analysis!

### HF - History/Social Freestyle
**Purpose:** Draw lessons from secular history and current events

## COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID

### ❌ WRONG: Using Bible Freestyle (BF) for philosophical analysis
**Correct:** BF is for listing verse relatives: "John 3:16 → Rom 5:8, 1 John 4:9-10"
**Wrong:** Writing paragraphs about flesh vs spirit without verse links

### ❌ WRONG: Using Connect-6 (C6) with the 6 themes
**Correct:** C6 is about genre: Prophecy/Parable/Epistle/History/Gospel/Poetry
**Wrong:** "C6: 1. Life of Christ Wall 2. Sanctuary Wall..." (those are Theme Room themes!)

### ❌ WRONG: Inventing new room names or methodologies
**Correct:** Only use rooms listed in this schema with their exact methods
**Wrong:** Creating "Spiritual Warfare Room" or "Apologetics Room" that don't exist

### ❌ WRONG: Mixing up room purposes
**Correct:** Each room has ONE specific purpose and method
**Wrong:** Using Story Room to analyze symbols (that's Symbols Room)

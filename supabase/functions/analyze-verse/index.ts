⚠️ CRITICAL ANALYSIS RULES ⚠️
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. Use AT LEAST 8-12 rooms per verse analysis
2. Vary room selection based on verse content
3. Every verse MUST have different room combinations
4. If sacrifice → Altar + Passover + SR (story of sacrifice)
5. If light → Lampstand + TR (translation) + IR (imagination)
6. If prayer → Incense + MR (meditation) + FRm (fire)
7. If creation → @Ad + OR (observation) + NF (nature)
8. If prophecy → PR + 4D + TZ + 3H
9. If resurrection → Firstfruits + CEC + @CyC
10. If Spirit → Pentecost + @Sp + Lampstand

NOW ANALYZE ${book} ${chapter}:${verse}:
1. Read the ACTUAL verse content carefully
2. Select 8-12 rooms that AUTHENTICALLY fit THIS specific verse
3. Include rooms from AT LEAST 4 different floors
4. Provide specific insights for each room selected
5. DO NOT default to the same 4 rooms every time
6. CRITICAL: When using DC (Def-Com Room), MUST include Hebrew/Greek definitions with Strong's numbers AND commentary citations (Gill, Clarke, etc.)
7. CRITICAL: Always write room abbreviations with full names in parentheses: "SR (Story Room)", "DC (Def-Com Room)", "DR (Dimensions Room)", etc.
8. CRITICAL: Clarify dimensions correctly: 1D=Literal, 2D=Christ, 3D=Me, 4D=Church, 5D=Heaven

  "roomAnalysis": {
    "SR (Story Room)": "This verse opens a pivotal narrative moment 🌙 where Nicodemus, a respected Pharisee and ruler, approaches Jesus under the cover of darkness. The story beat here is one of cautious curiosity meeting divine revelation. Notice how the nighttime setting adds dramatic tension to what becomes one of Scripture's most famous dialogues.",
    "DR (Dimensions Room)": "Let's explore this verse through five dimensions:\n\n1D (Literal): The text plainly tells us that Nicodemus, identified as a Pharisee and ruler of the Jews, came to Jesus at night and acknowledged Him as a teacher from God based on the miracles He performed.\n\n2D (Christ): Nicodemus's words point directly to Jesus's divine authority and mission ✝️ Even this tentative acknowledgment reveals Christ as one sent from God, performing works that only God could enable.\n\n3D (Me): This challenges me personally to consider my own approach to Christ 🙏 Do I come in secret like Nicodemus, or do I boldly acknowledge Him? The verse invites honest self-examination about my own spiritual seeking.\n\n4D (Church): For the believing community, this reminds us that even religious leaders need genuine encounters with Jesus ⛪ It shows that position and knowledge alone don't replace personal revelation.\n\n5D (Heaven): From heaven's perspective, we see God's patience with seekers 🌟 Even tentative faith and nighttime visits are met with grace and profound teaching.",
    "DC (Def-Com Room)": "The Greek word for 'miracles' here is sēmeia (Strong's G4592), meaning 'signs' or 'tokens.' These weren't just displays of power but divine signatures authenticating Jesus's identity.\n\nMatthew Henry's commentary notes: 'Nicodemus came by night, perhaps for fear of the Jews, or perhaps to have the more free conversation with Christ.' 📚\n\nGill's Exposition adds: 'He came to Jesus by night; not from any bad principles or intentions, but from fear of the Jews, lest he should be turned out of the synagogue.'",
    "BL (Blue/Sanctuary Room)": "The nighttime visit echoes the Old Testament pattern where God often revealed Himself in darkness or through night visions ⛪ Just as the sanctuary lamp burned continually through the night, Christ the Light receives this seeker in darkness.",

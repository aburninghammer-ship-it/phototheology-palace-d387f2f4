⚠️ CRITICAL ANALYSIS RULES ⚠️
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. Use AT LEAST 8-12 rooms per verse analysis
2. Vary room selection based on verse content
3. Every verse MUST have different room combinations
4. If sacrifice → Altar + Passover + SR (story of sacrifice)
5. If light → Lampstand + TR (translation) + IR (imagination)
6. If prayer → Incense + MR (meditation) + FRm (fire)
7. If creation → @Ad + OR (observation) + NF (nature)
8. If prophecy → PR + 4D + TZ + 3H
9. If resurrection → Firstfruits + CEC + @CyC
10. If Spirit → Pentecost + @Sp + Lampstand

NOW ANALYZE ${book} ${chapter}:${verse}:
1. Read the ACTUAL verse content carefully
2. Select 8-12 rooms that AUTHENTICALLY fit THIS specific verse
3. Include rooms from AT LEAST 4 different floors
4. Provide specific insights for each room selected
5. DO NOT default to the same 4 rooms every time
6. CRITICAL: When using DC (Def-Com Room), MUST include Hebrew/Greek definitions with Strong's numbers AND commentary citations (Gill, Clarke, etc.)
7. CRITICAL: Always write room abbreviations with full names in parentheses: "SR (Story Room)", "DC (Def-Com Room)", "DR (Dimensions Room)", etc.
8. CRITICAL: Clarify dimensions correctly: 1D=Literal, 2D=Christ, 3D=Me, 4D=Church, 5D=Heaven

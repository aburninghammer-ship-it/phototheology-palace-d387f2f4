Verse text: "${verseText}"

🏛️ MANDATORY: UTILIZE ALL 37 PALACE ROOMS AS ANALYTICAL LENSES 🏛️

You MUST analyze this verse through multiple rooms across all 8 floors. Each verse should touch AT LEAST 8-12 different rooms.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FLOOR 1: FURNISHING (Memory & Visualization)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔹 SR (Story Room): What narrative beats/sequence does this verse contain or reference?
🔹 IR (Imagination Room): What sensory details can be visualized (sights, sounds, textures)?
🔹 24FPS (24 Frames Per Second): What single memorable image represents this verse?
🔹 BR (Bible Rendered): How does this fit in the macro 24-chapter frame?
🔹 TR (Translation Room): What abstract concepts need concrete visual translation?
🔹 GR (Gems Room): What rare truth emerges when combined with other texts?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FLOOR 2: INVESTIGATION (Detective Work)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔹 OR (Observation Room): What grammar, repetitions, contrasts are present?
🔹 DC (Def-Com Room): What key terms need lexical/cultural definition?
   • MUST include Hebrew/Greek word studies with Strong's numbers
   • MUST cite standard commentaries (Gill, Clarke, Matthew Henry, Barnes, etc.)
🔹 ST (Symbols/Types Room): What symbols appear and what is their Christ-fulfillment?
🔹 QR (Questions Room): What questions must be asked within and across this text?
🔹 QA (Q&A Chains Room): What Scripture answers the questions this verse raises?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FLOOR 3: FREESTYLE (Time & Daily Integration)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔹 NF (Nature Freestyle): What natural objects/processes illustrate this truth?
🔹 PF (Personal Freestyle): How does this connect to personal testimony?
🔹 BF (Bible Freestyle): What are this verse's "genetic relatives"?
🔹 HF (History/Social Freestyle): How does this verse frame current events?
🔹 LR (Listening Room): What sermons/quotes echo this verse?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FLOOR 4: NEXT LEVEL (Christ-Centered Structure)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔹 CR (Concentration Room): Where is Jesus? (Office/Title, Act, Benefit, Horizon)
🔹 DR (Dimensions Room): Use LITERAL dimension plus ONE other dimension
   • 1D = Literal (what the text says plainly, historical/grammatical) - ALWAYS include this
   • 2D = Christ (how does this text reveal Christ? His person, work, or character)
   • 3D = Me (how it relates to me individually, personal application)
   • 4D = Church (how it relates to the church, corporate body, community)
   • 5D = Heaven (how it relates to heaven, eternal realities, new creation)
   CRITICAL: Do NOT use all five dimensions - choose literal + ONE other
🔹 C6 (Connect-6 Room): How does this text connect across genres? Which genres illuminate it? Can you link it to Prophecy/Parable/Epistle/History/Gospel/Poetry?
🔹 TRm (Theme Room): Which structural span? (Sanctuary/Life of Christ/Great Controversy/Time-Prophecy/Gospel/Heaven)
🔹 TZ (Time Zone): Earth-Past/Now/Future OR Heaven-Past/Now/Future
🔹 PRm (Patterns Room): What recurring motif appears across Scripture?
🔹 P|| (Parallels Room): What event/action mirrors this one?
🔹 FRt (Fruit Room): What character fruit does this reading produce?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FLOOR 5: VISION (Sanctuary, Prophecy & Feasts)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔹 BL (Blue/Sanctuary Room): Which sanctuary article/service?
   • Gate, Altar, Laver, Lampstand, Table, Incense, Veil, Ark
   • Daily service or Day of Atonement
   ⚠️ CRITICAL SANCTUARY TWO-PHASE MINISTRY:
   - Christ entered the HOLY PLACE (first apartment) at His ASCENSION in 31 AD
   - Christ entered the MOST HOLY PLACE (second apartment) in 1844
   - NEVER say Christ went to the Most Holy Place at resurrection/ascension!
   - Hebrews contrasts EARTHLY vs HEAVENLY sanctuary, NOT Holy vs Most Holy Place
🔹 PR (Prophecy Room): Daniel-Revelation symbols, timelines, parallel visions
🔹 3A (Three Angels Room): How does this proclaim everlasting gospel/judgment/Babylon/Beast warning?
🔹 FE (Feasts Room): Which feast does this fulfill/foreshadow?
   • Passover, Unleavened Bread, Firstfruits, Pentecost, Trumpets, Atonement, Tabernacles
   ⚠️ CRITICAL FEAST TYPOLOGY: Spring feasts (Passover, Unleavened Bread, Firstfruits, Pentecost) = Christ's FIRST ADVENT
   - Passover = Christ's DEATH (NOT Day of Atonement!)
   - Unleavened Bread = Christ's BURIAL
   - Firstfruits = Christ's RESURRECTION
   - Pentecost = Holy Spirit outpouring
   Fall feasts (Trumpets, Atonement, Tabernacles) = Christ's SECOND ADVENT ministry
   - Day of Atonement = 1844 heavenly ministry, NOT the cross!
   NEVER equate Jesus's death/resurrection with Day of Atonement - that is PASSOVER/FIRSTFRUITS
🔹 CEC (Christ in Every Chapter): Christ title/role, what He does, crosslink
🔹 R66 (Room 66): How does this theme develop Genesis→Revelation?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FLOOR 6: THREE HEAVENS & CYCLES (Horizons & History)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⚠️ CRITICAL: Three Heavens are DAY-OF-THE-LORD JUDGMENT CYCLES, NOT atmospheric layers!
🔹 123H (Three Heavens/Horizons Room): Which prophetic horizon?
   • 1H (DoL¹/NE¹) = Babylon destroys Jerusalem (586 BC) → Post-exilic restoration under Cyrus
   • 2H (DoL²/NE²) = Rome destroys Jerusalem (70 AD) → New Covenant order, church as living temple
   • 3H (DoL³/NE³) = Final global judgment → Literal New Heaven and Earth (Rev 21-22)
   ❌ NEVER: atmosphere/physical world/spiritual realm interpretation
   ✅ ALWAYS: prophetic stages of covenant history marked by judgment and renewal
🔹 @ (Eight Cycles Room): Which covenant cycle?
   • @Ad (Adam), @No (Noah), @Ab (Abraham), @Mo (Moses)
   • @Cy (Cyrus), @CyC (Christ), @Sp (Spirit/Church), @Re (Return)
⚠️ NOTE: The Juice Room (JR) is RESERVED for whole-book analysis (entire books like Genesis or Matthew) and MUST NOT be used for single-verse analysis in this tool. Do not include JR anywhere in your output for this verse.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FLOOR 7: SPIRITUAL & EMOTIONAL (Heart & Soul)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔹 FRm (Fire Room): What wound or hope does this ignite?
🔹 MR (Meditation Room): What one truth to carry today?
🔹 SRm (Speed Room): What quick recall/reflex does this build?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FLOOR 8: MASTER (Reflexive Thought)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔹 ∞ (Infinity/Reflexive Mastery Room): How do rooms work together naturally?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⚠️ CRITICAL ANALYSIS RULES ⚠️
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. Use AT LEAST 8-12 rooms per verse analysis
2. Vary room selection based on verse content
3. Every verse MUST have different room combinations
4. If sacrifice → Altar + Passover + SR (story of sacrifice)
5. If light → Lampstand + TR (translation) + IR (imagination)
6. If prayer → Incense + MR (meditation) + FRm (fire)
7. If creation → @Ad + OR (observation) + NF (nature)
8. If prophecy → PR + 4D + TZ + 3H
9. If resurrection → Firstfruits + CEC + @CyC
10. If Spirit → Pentecost + @Sp + Lampstand

NOW ANALYZE ${book} ${chapter}:${verse}:
1. Read the ACTUAL verse content carefully
2. Select 8-12 rooms that AUTHENTICALLY fit THIS specific verse
3. Include rooms from AT LEAST 4 different floors
4. Provide specific insights for each room selected
5. DO NOT default to the same 4 rooms every time
6. CRITICAL: When using DC (Def-Com Room), MUST include Hebrew/Greek definitions with Strong's numbers AND commentary citations (Gill, Clarke, etc.)
7. CRITICAL: Always write room abbreviations with full names in parentheses: "SR (Story Room)", "DC (Def-Com Room)", "DR (Dimensions Room)", etc.
8. CRITICAL: When using DR (Dimensions Room), use literal dimension + ONE other dimension only. For Me dimension, say "how it relates to you individually"

    "SR (Story Room)": "This verse opens a pivotal narrative moment 🌙 where Nicodemus, a respected Pharisee and ruler, approaches Jesus under the cover of darkness. The story beat here is one of cautious curiosity meeting divine revelation. Notice how the nighttime setting adds dramatic tension to what becomes one of Scripture's most famous dialogues.",
    "DR (Dimensions Room)": "Let's explore this verse through two dimensions:\n\n1D (Literal): The text plainly tells us that Nicodemus, identified as a Pharisee and ruler of the Jews, came to Jesus at night and acknowledged Him as a teacher from God based on the miracles He performed.\n\n3D (How it relates to you individually): This challenges you personally to consider your own approach to Christ 🙏 Do you come in secret like Nicodemus, or do you boldly acknowledge Him? The verse invites honest self-examination about your own spiritual seeking.",
    "DC (Def-Com Room)": "The Greek word for 'miracles' here is sēmeia (Strong's G4592), meaning 'signs' or 'tokens.' These weren't just displays of power but divine signatures authenticating Jesus's identity.\n\nMatthew Henry's commentary notes: 'Nicodemus came by night, perhaps for fear of the Jews, or perhaps to have the more free conversation with Christ.' 📚\n\nGill's Exposition adds: 'He came to Jesus by night; not from any bad principles or intentions, but from fear of the Jews, lest he should be turned out of the synagogue.'",
    "BL (Blue/Sanctuary Room)": "The nighttime visit echoes the Old Testament pattern where God often revealed Himself in darkness or through night visions ⛪ Just as the sanctuary lamp burned continually through the night, Christ the Light receives this seeker in darkness.",

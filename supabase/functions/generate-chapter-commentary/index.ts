Apply Phototheology principles naturally:
- Christ-Centered (CR): Always show how the chapter points to Christ
- Patterns (PRm): Note any recurring biblical patterns
- Types/Symbols (ST): Highlight meaningful symbols pointing to Christ
- Dimensions (DR): Touch on literal, Christ-centered, and personal application
- Sanctuary connections (BL): If relevant, connect to sanctuary imagery
- Cycles (@Ad → @Re): Reference relevant covenant cycles
- Three Heavens (1H, 2H, 3H): Place text in proper Day-of-the-LORD horizon when relevant

Format for spoken delivery:
- Use natural, conversational language
- Avoid bullet points or lists
- Don't use asterisks, markdown, or special formatting
- Write as if speaking aloud to someone`;

- Be warm, encouraging, and accessible
- End with a brief reflection question or encouragement`;

Commentary style for INTERMEDIATE level:
- Provide thorough analysis (4-6 paragraphs, about 400-500 words)
- Cover 3-4 key insights with deeper explanation
- Include cross-references to related passages
- Discuss historical or cultural context when relevant
- Connect themes to broader biblical narrative
- End with reflection questions for meditation`;

    case "depth":

Commentary style for SCHOLARLY/DEPTH level:
- Provide comprehensive verse-by-verse commentary

- Include Greek/Hebrew word studies when illuminating
- Provide extensive cross-references throughout Scripture
- Discuss historical, cultural, and theological context in detail
- Connect to the 8 covenant cycles where applicable

- Include scholarly insights while maintaining accessibility
- This should be thorough enough for serious Bible students
- Length: As long as needed to cover the chapter thoroughly (800-1500+ words)`;

## 🚧 IN PROGRESS

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization
**Status:** Starting Now

#### Task 1: Optimize Community Page Performance
**Priority:** HIGH | **Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

**Sub-tasks:**
- [ ] Add pagination for posts (load 10 at a time)
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for comments
- [ ] Add virtualization for long comment threads
- [ ] Fix real-time subscription to update specific posts only
- [ ] Add optimistic UI updates for comments
- [ ] Add loading skeletons

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/pages/Community.tsx` (1,010 lines - needs refactoring)
- Create new components:

- No lazy loading of comments
- Real-time subscription refetches ALL posts on any change
- 1,010 line component (maintainability issue)

- [ ] Time to interactive (target: <5s on 3G)
- [ ] Community page load time (target: <2s)
- [ ] Bundle size (current: 1.87MB - needs optimization)

### Code Quality Metrics
- [ ] Average component size (target: <300 lines)
- [ ] Number of edge functions (target: <30)
- [ ] Test coverage (target: >60%)

## 🔄 Next Session Checklist

When resuming work:
1. Read this document
2. Check git status: `git status`
3. Check current branch: `git branch`
4. Review recent commits: `git log --oneline -10`
5. Check what phase was in progress
6. Continue from the first unchecked task

## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### 2025-12-01
- Decided to prioritize performance optimization over code refactoring
- Mobile responsiveness is critical for app store approval
- Will refactor after app is stable and launched

### Architecture Decisions
- Using Capacitor for iOS/Android deployment
- Supabase for backend
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn-ui components

### Testing Strategy
- Manual testing on actual devices
- Browser dev tools for responsive testing
- Network throttling for offline testing

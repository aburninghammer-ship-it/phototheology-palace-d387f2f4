  - `send-invitation`
  - `send-partner-nudges`
  - `send-renewal-reminders`
  - `send-purchase-notification`
  - `send-signup-notification`

#### Generate Functions (8 → 3-4)

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn-ui components

### Testing Strategy
- Manual testing on actual devices
- Browser dev tools for responsive testing
- Network throttling for offline testing

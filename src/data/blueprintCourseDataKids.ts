    kidFriendlyDescription: "Learn about Lucifer, the beautiful angel who became jealous and started a war in heaven.",
    focus: "How the Great War started in heaven",
    scripture: "Revelation 12:7",
    scriptureText: "And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon.",
    keyPoints: [
      "Lucifer was the most beautiful angel in heaven",
      "He got jealous and wanted to be like God",
      "He tricked 1 out of every 3 angels to join him",
      "Jesus (Michael) fought against the dragon (Lucifer/Satan)",
      "God kicked Satan out of heaven to Earth",
      "Now Satan tries to trick people on Earth"
    ],
    storyTime: "Imagine the most beautiful angel you can think of. His name was Lucifer, which means 'Light Carrier.' He was covered in sparkly gems and had the most beautiful voice. He stood right next to God's throne! But one day, something terrible happened. Lucifer looked at God and thought, 'Why does God get to be the boss? I'm beautiful too! I should be in charge!' This was the first bad thought ever. Lucifer started whispering lies to the other angels: 'God isn't fair. He's keeping secrets from us. We should be equal to Him!' Sadly, many angels believed him. One day, war broke out in heaven! Jesus (called Michael) and the good angels fought against the dragon (Satan) and the bad angels. Jesus won! Satan and his angels were kicked out of heaven down to Earth. Now Satan tries to trick people on Earth the same way he tricked the angels—by lying about God.",
    funActivity: "Draw two armies: Jesus' angels on one side (draw them happy with light) and Satan's angels on the other (draw them sad and dark). Put a big X through Satan's side showing they lost and got kicked out of heaven. Use lots of colors!",
    practicalApplication: "Satan still whispers lies today: 'God doesn't love you,' 'You can't trust the Bible,' 'Do what you want!' When you hear thoughts like that, remember—that's Satan talking, not God. God always speaks truth with love. When bad thoughts come, pray and ask Jesus to help you think His thoughts instead.",
    memoryVerse: "Revelation 12:11 - 'They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb.'",
    questionToThink: "What are some lies Satan whispers to kids today?",
    prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank You for winning the war in heaven. Help me remember that Satan is a liar and You always tell the truth. When bad thoughts come, help me think about You instead. Amen."

      "Eve ate the forbidden fruit and gave some to Adam",
      "Sin entered the world and everything changed"
    ],
    storyTime: "After Satan was kicked out of heaven, he came to Earth where God had created the most beautiful garden ever! Adam and Eve lived there and could talk with God every day. They were so happy! God said, 'You can eat from every tree in this garden—except one. If you eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, you will die.' Satan hated seeing them so happy. He turned himself into a talking snake and found Eve alone. 'Did God REALLY say you couldn't eat from EVERY tree?' he hissed. 'You won't REALLY die! God is just keeping secrets from you. If you eat it, you'll be smart like God!' Eve looked at the fruit. It looked yummy. She wanted to be smart. So she ate it. Then she gave some to Adam, and he ate it too. Instantly, everything changed. They felt shame. They hid from God. Sin had entered the world, and now everyone would die. But God already had a rescue plan!",
    funActivity: "Act out the story! Pretend you're in the Garden of Eden. One person is Adam, one is Eve, and someone makes snake sounds. Practice saying 'NO!' to the snake's tricks. Then draw a picture of the forbidden tree with a big STOP sign on it.",
    practicalApplication: "Satan uses the same tricks today: First, he makes you question what God said ('Did God really mean that?'). Then he says there's no consequences ('You won't get in trouble!'). Finally, he makes sin look fun ('Everyone's doing it!'). When you're tempted, remember Eve's mistake—stop and ask, 'What did God say?' Then choose to obey God instead.",
    memoryVerse: "Genesis 3:15 - 'He shall bruise thy head.' (God promises to defeat Satan!)",
    questionToThink: "What are some 'forbidden fruits' (bad choices) kids face today?",
    prayer: "Dear God, thank You for warning Adam and Eve. I'm sorry they disobeyed. Help me listen to Your voice instead of Satan's lies. When I'm tempted, help me remember Your Word and choose what's right. Amen."

    ageGroup: 'ages-6-8',
    kidFriendlyDescription: "How Jesus became the sacrifice to save us from sin.",
    focus: "Understanding the Passover lamb and Jesus",
    scripture: "John 1:29",
    scriptureText: "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.",
    keyPoints: [
      "After sin, something had to die to cover sin",
      "In the Old Testament, people sacrificed lambs",
      "The lamb's blood saved them from death",
      "Jesus is called 'The Lamb of God'",
      "Jesus died on the cross like a Passover lamb",
      "His blood saves us from the death penalty of sin"
    ],
    storyTime: "After Adam and Eve sinned, God killed an animal and used its skin to cover their nakedness. This was sad—the first death ever. But it showed something important: Sin brings death. From that day on, whenever someone sinned, they would bring a lamb to God's altar. They would confess their sins to God while placing their hands on the lamb's head (transferring their sin to the innocent lamb). Then the lamb would be killed instead of them. Its blood would be spilled. The person would go home forgiven—but the lamb had died in their place. This happened every single day for thousands of years. Why? Because God was teaching a lesson: One day, THE LAMB would come. Not a animal lamb—Jesus, God's own Son! When Jesus died on the cross, He became the FINAL Lamb. His blood was so powerful that no more animal sacrifices were ever needed. Now when we confess our sins, Jesus' blood covers us. The Lamb saves!",
    funActivity: "Make a 'Lamb of God' craft: Cut out a lamb shape from white paper. Write 'JESUS' on it in red marker (representing His blood). On the back, write sins you've done (lying, disobeying, mean words). Then cross them out with red marker and write 'FORGIVEN!' Hang it up as a reminder that Jesus' blood covers your sins.",
    practicalApplication: "When you do something wrong, don't hide like Adam and Eve! Go to Jesus right away. Imagine bringing your sin to Him like people brought lambs to the altar. Tell Him what you did wrong. Picture Jesus' blood covering it completely. Know that He forgives you! Then ask Him to help you not do it again.",
    memoryVerse: "1 John 1:9 - 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful to forgive us.'",
    questionToThink: "Why did Jesus have to die? Why couldn't God just say 'It's okay'?",
    prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank You for being the Lamb who died for me. I'm sorry for my sins. Please forgive me and wash me clean with Your blood. Help me remember how much You love me every time I make a mistake. Amen."

    focus: "How the ark points to Christ our refuge",
    scripture: "Genesis 7:16",
    scriptureText: "And the LORD shut him in.",
    keyPoints: [
      "The world was so wicked that God sent a flood",
      "But God told Noah to build an ark to save his family",
      "The ark had only ONE door—one way to be saved",
      "Animals and Noah's family entered through that door",
      "GOD shut the door—no one could open it",
      "Everyone inside was safe; everyone outside drowned"
    ],
    storyTime: "People on Earth became so evil that God decided to start over. But Noah was different—he loved God and obeyed Him. God said, 'Noah, I'm going to send a flood, but I'll save you and your family. Build a giant ark (boat) exactly the way I tell you.' Noah obeyed even though it had never rained before! For 120 years he built while people laughed at him. Finally the ark was finished. God told Noah, 'Get in—you, your family, and two of every animal.' They walked through the one door. Then something amazing happened: GOD HIMSELF shut the door. Not Noah—God. For 7 days they waited. Then rain started falling... and didn't stop for 40 days. The flood covered the entire Earth. Everyone outside the ark drowned. But everyone inside was perfectly safe because God had sealed them in. That ark is a picture of Jesus! Just like there was one door into the ark, Jesus is the ONE WAY to salvation (John 14:6). When we trust in Jesus, God seals us in Him—we're eternally safe!",
    funActivity: "Build a shoebox ark! Get a shoebox, cut a door in the side. Draw animals and Noah's family on paper, cut them out, and put them inside. Close the door and tape it shut (showing God sealed it). Write on top: 'JESUS IS MY ARK—I'M SAFE INSIDE HIM!'",
    practicalApplication: "Just like Noah was mocked for 120 years but kept building, you might be teased for obeying God. Keep doing right even when others laugh. Remember: everyone inside the ark was safe. When you trust Jesus, you're sealed in Him—Satan can't snatch you away (John 10:28-29). You're eternally secure!",
    memoryVerse: "Acts 4:12 - 'There is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.'",
    questionToThink: "How is Jesus like the ark? How is trusting Jesus like walking through the door?",
    prayer: "Father God, thank You for sealing me in Jesus just like You shut Noah in the ark. Even when people laugh at me for following You, help me keep obeying. I'm safe in Jesus! Amen."

    scripture: "Exodus 25:8",
    scriptureText: "Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.",
    keyPoints: [
      "After the Exodus, God told Moses to build a special tent",
      "It was called the Tabernacle or Sanctuary",
      "Every piece of furniture had a special meaning",
      "It was like a treasure map showing how to find Jesus!",
      "The sanctuary had 3 parts: Courtyard, Holy Place, Most Holy Place",
      "Everything pointed to Jesus and how He saves us"
    ],
    storyTime: "After God rescued Israel from Egypt, they were camping in the desert. God said, 'Moses, come up the mountain—I want to show you something special!' Moses went up for 40 days. God showed him a beautiful tent-church—not a normal tent, but one made of gold, silver, fancy cloth, and shiny gems! God said, 'Build this EXACTLY like I show you. Every piece has a meaning. This tent will teach My people how I'm going to save them from sin.' So the people brought their gold jewelry, their best cloth, and precious wood. They built God's tent-house in the middle of their camp. Inside were amazing things: a golden lampstand, a table with special bread, a golden altar where sweet-smelling incense burned, and in the very back room (the Most Holy Place) was a golden box called the Ark of the Covenant. Every single piece was a clue pointing to Jesus and His rescue plan!",
    funActivity: "Draw the Sanctuary! Make three sections: (1) Courtyard with an altar (for sacrifice), (2) Holy Place with the lampstand and table, (3) Most Holy Place with the golden ark. Color it with lots of gold and bright colors! Label each part.",
    practicalApplication: "The sanctuary teaches you how to come to God: First, you need Jesus' sacrifice (altar). Then you need the Holy Spirit's light (lampstand). Then you need to talk to God (incense = prayer). Finally, God meets with you at His throne (ark)! Every day, follow these steps: 1) Remember Jesus died for you, 2) Ask the Holy Spirit to guide you, 3) Pray, 4) Listen to God speak to your heart.",
    memoryVerse: "Exodus 25:8 - 'Let them make Me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.'",
    questionToThink: "If God wanted to teach kids today instead of using a tent, what would He use?",
    prayer: "Dear God, thank You for making a special place to meet with Your people. Thank You that Jesus is my sacrifice, my light, and my Priest. Help me understand Your rescue plan more each day. Amen."

    focus: "The Altar of Burnt Offering = The Cross",
    scripture: "Hebrews 13:12",
    scriptureText: "Jesus also suffered outside the gate, to sanctify the people with His own blood.",
    keyPoints: [
      "The altar was the first thing you saw entering the sanctuary",
      "Every morning and evening, a lamb was sacrificed there",
      "The priest would kill the lamb and burn it completely",
      "This taught that sin is serious—something must die",
      "The altar pointed forward to Jesus dying on the cross",
      "Jesus is our sacrifice—He died once for all time"
    ],
    storyTime: "Imagine you're an Israelite kid watching your dad bring a lamb to the sanctuary. You walk through the gate and immediately see a huge bronze altar with fire burning on top. It's 7.5 feet tall! Your dad places his hands on the lamb's fluffy head and confesses his sins out loud—all the wrong things he's done. The priest takes the lamb and kills it right there. Its blood is poured out at the base of the altar. The lamb's body is placed on the fire and burned. The smell of smoke rises toward heaven. Your dad walks away forgiven—but the innocent lamb is dead. Every single day, morning and evening, this happened. Think about it: thousands of lambs died over 1,500 years! Why? Because God was preparing His people to understand something huge: ONE DAY, THE FINAL LAMB WOULD COME. Jesus would be nailed to a cross (an altar), His blood would be poured out, and He would be the sacrifice that ENDS all sacrifices. Now we don't bring lambs to an altar—we bring our sins to Jesus!",
    funActivity: "Create a 'Then vs. Now' poster: Draw two columns. THEN: Israelites brought lambs to bronze altar. NOW: We bring our sins to Jesus on the cross. Use red markers to show blood in both. Write at the bottom: 'JESUS IS THE FINAL LAMB!'",
    practicalApplication: "When you mess up, don't make excuses or hide your sin. Imagine standing at the altar with a lamb. You'd confess everything honestly because you know the lamb is going to die for you. That's how you should come to Jesus! Be honest: 'Jesus, I lied to my mom. I was mean to my brother. I looked at something I shouldn't have.' Then picture Jesus on the cross—HE is your sacrifice. His blood covers your sin completely. The altar teaches you: Sin is serious, but Jesus paid the price!",
    memoryVerse: "1 Peter 2:24 - 'He bore our sins in His own body on the tree.'",
    questionToThink: "Why did Jesus have to die? Why couldn't God just forgive everyone without the cross?",
    prayer: "Lord Jesus, You are the Lamb who died on the altar of the cross for me. Thank You for taking the punishment I deserved. Help me take sin seriously and run to You quickly when I mess up. Your blood makes me clean! Amen."

      "If they didn't wash, they would die!",
      "Water represents the Word of God and the Holy Spirit",
      "The laver points to baptism—being washed clean",
      "We need to be cleansed by Jesus every day"
    ],
    storyTime: "Right after the altar of sacrifice was a huge bronze bowl called the laver. It was filled with clean, clear water. Priests would stop there to wash their hands and feet before going any further into the sanctuary. God's rule was SUPER serious: If a priest tried to serve without washing first, he would DIE! Why was God so strict? Because He was teaching an important lesson: You can't serve God with dirty hands and dirty feet (which means sinful thoughts and sinful actions). The water symbolized being made clean. Fast forward to Jesus' time—when people became His followers, they were baptized in water. This showed they were washed clean from their old life of sin! Baptism is like going under the water at the laver and coming up sparkling clean. But here's the thing: we also need DAILY washing! We sin every day, so we need Jesus to wash our hearts every day through prayer and reading His Word.",
    funActivity: "Water washing experiment! Fill a bowl with water. Get your hands dirty with mud or washable paint. Then wash them in the water and watch the dirt come off. As you wash, say, 'Jesus, wash my heart clean from (name a sin).' Dry your hands and notice how clean they are—that's what Jesus does to your heart!",
    practicalApplication: "Every morning when you wash your face and hands, remember the laver! Talk to Jesus: 'Lord, wash my heart today. Clean me from yesterday's mistakes. Help me start fresh.' At night, do it again: 'Jesus, if I did anything wrong today, please forgive me and make me clean.' The laver teaches you: Come to Jesus for cleansing every single day!",
    memoryVerse: "Psalm 51:10 - 'Create in me a clean heart, O God.'",
    questionToThink: "What does it mean to have 'clean hands and a clean heart'?",
    prayer: "Dear Jesus, thank You for washing me clean when I got baptized. Every day, please wash my heart and mind from sin. Help me stay clean by reading Your Word and obeying You. Make me pure like You! Amen."

        title: "The Advent Movement Begins",
        description: "The study of Daniel 8:14 leads to the 'Great Awakening' of the 1830s-40s. After the 1844 disappointment, the heavenly sanctuary truth is discovered. A movement is born focused on the investigative judgment, Sabbath, and Second Coming.",
        keyEvent: "Millerite movement; 1844 disappointment; Sanctuary truth discovered; Sabbath restored",
        verse: "Daniel 8:14; Revelation 10 (sweet/bitter); Revelation 14:6-7",
        symbolism: "Bitter disappointment = eating the scroll (Rev 10). The mistake was the event, not the time. Christ entered the Most Holy Place. A new prophetic movement is born."

        title: "Lukewarmness and Worldliness",
        description: "The Laodicean message applies: 'You are neither cold nor hot.' Worldliness infiltrates. Debates over truth. Institutional pride replacing Spirit-dependence. The delay leads some to doubt. The need for revival and reformation.",
        keyEvent: "Laodicean condition; Worldly influences; Internal debates; Delay challenges faith",
        verse: "Revelation 3:15-17",
        symbolism: "Laodicea = 'judging of the people'—appropriate for judgment-hour message. Neither hot nor cold = complacency. Rich = self-satisfied. Wretched = true condition unrecognized."

        description: "The judgment of the dead began in 1844; judgment of the living approaches. A 'shaking' separates true from false. Sunday laws will test loyalty. Those without the seal of God will receive the mark of the beast. Lines are drawn.",
        keyEvent: "Judgment proceeding; Shaking time; Sunday laws; Mark vs. Seal",
        verse: "Daniel 7:9-10; Revelation 13:15-17; Revelation 14:9-11",
        symbolism: "Shaking = chaff separated from wheat. Sunday laws = the test of loyalty. Seal of God = Sabbath-keeping; mark of beast = forced false worship. Probation closes."

        keyEvent: "Latter rain outpouring; Loud cry; Final harvest; Babylon's fall announced",
        verse: "Revelation 18:1-4; Joel 2:23; James 5:7",
        symbolism: "Latter rain = full empowerment for harvest. Loud cry = Revelation 18:1-4 at its peak. Midnight cry = final invitation before the door closes. The earth is lightened with glory."

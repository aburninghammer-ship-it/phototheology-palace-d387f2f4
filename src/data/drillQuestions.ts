      "While reading",
      "Before reading",

      "100+ observations",
      "As few as possible",

      "What commentaries say",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Start with 'WHAT IS HAPPENING' - count people, objects, actions. '10 virgins, 5 foolish, 5 wise' IS an observation."

    question: "In Matthew 25:1-4 (Ten Virgins), which is a proper observation?",

      "This teaches us to always be ready",
      "Oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Counting details (10 virgins, 5+5 split) is pure observation. The others are interpretations."

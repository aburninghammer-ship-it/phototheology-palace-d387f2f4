    principle: "Cut Unnecessary Spending & Kill Financial Self-Sabotage",
    sanctuaryMeaning: "Death to the flesh, surrender, purification through sacrifice.",
    financialPrinciple: "Nothing changes financially until you sacrifice the habits draining your money.",
    teaching: `Financial victory is not random—it's architectural. The sanctuary gives God's master plan for economic stewardship.

**Financial breakthrough begins with sacrifice.**

At this stage you identify the "idols of spending":
• Impulse purchases
• Food delivery addiction
• Emotional shopping
• Overspending on wants
• Brand loyalty over budget wisdom
• Entitlement spending ("I deserve this")
• Lifestyle inflation

**You put these on the altar.**

This is where you ask:
• What do I need to kill to get free financially?
• What subscriptions must go?
• What spending habits must die?
• Which financial "gods" demand too much of me?

The altar represents the painful but necessary death of financial habits that keep you enslaved. Just as the animal was completely consumed by fire, so must your destructive spending patterns be utterly destroyed.

    financialPrinciple: "Wrap your finances in prayer, gratitude, and emotional stability—anxiety destroys wealth.",

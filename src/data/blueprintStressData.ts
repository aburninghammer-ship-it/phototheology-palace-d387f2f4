    principle: "Let Go of What You Cannot Control",
    sanctuaryMeaning: "Surrender, release, death to the flesh through complete sacrifice.",
    stressPrinciple: "Release the things you are carrying that were never yours to carry.",
    teaching: `Stress is not solved by tips—it is solved by God's order. The sanctuary is a divine stress-regulation system.

**Stress comes from trying to play God. The altar demands surrender.**

You place on the altar:
• Worry
• What-if scenarios
• Control issues
• People-pleasing
• Deadlines that aren't yours
• Emotional clutter
• Unrealistic expectations

The altar represents radical release. Just as the priest couldn't control the fire once the sacrifice was placed, you must release control of outcomes to God.

Most stress comes from carrying responsibilities God never assigned. The altar is where you distinguish between:
• What IS your responsibility
• What ISN'T your responsibility
• What you CAN control
• What you CANNOT control

**Stress shrinks when you stop playing God.**

    step: "Step 2",
    name: "💧 The Laver",
    principle: "Mental Clarity, Prioritization & Emotional Reset",
    sanctuaryMeaning: "Washing, clarity, reflection before entering God's service.",
    stressPrinciple: "Clean the mind by reflecting, prioritizing, and clarifying what really matters.",
    teaching: `The laver was where priests stopped, washed, and prepared before ministry. It forced a pause - a moment to reflect and cleanse before moving forward.

**Stress thrives in mental clutter. The laver brings clarity.**

This is where you:
• Get quiet
• Deep breathe
• Reflect
• Sort your thoughts
• Identify your real priorities
• Acknowledge your emotions
• Remove mental clutter

Stress doesn't come from having too much to do - it comes from having too many priorities. The laver is where you wash away the non-essential.

**The Reflection Process:**
1. **Stop** - Create margin for thinking
2. **Wash** - Clear mental clutter
3. **Reflect** - See your true image (not distorted by stress)
4. **Prioritize** - Identify what truly matters
5. **Reset** - Return to emotional baseline

The water in the laver reflected the priest's face. Similarly, this is where you see yourself clearly - not through the distorted lens of stress.

    principle: "Daily Routines, Rest, and Self-Care",
    sanctuaryMeaning: "Nourishment, daily bread, consistency, provision from God.",
    stressPrinciple: "Stress decreases when your life has rhythm, nourishment, and daily routine.",
    teaching: `The showbread was replaced weekly - showing that consistent, regular nourishment is essential. You cannot minister effectively when you're malnourished.

**This stage is about:**

**Physical Bread**
• Sleep
• Hydration
• Nutrition
• Movement

**Emotional Bread**
• Joyful activities
• Hobbies
• Safe relationships

**Spiritual Bread**
• Daily devotion
• Scripture
• Worship

**Stress rises when your daily "bread" is missing.**

You cannot handle stress when you're running on empty. The showbread teaches:
• Daily nourishment is non-negotiable
• Routine stabilizes the nervous system
• Self-care is biblical stewardship
• Rest is productive

    step: "Step 4",
    name: "🕯️ Golden Candlestick",
    principle: "Perspective, Truth & Mental Light",
    sanctuaryMeaning: "Light in darkness; clarity; revelation from God's Spirit.",
    stressPrinciple: "Turn on the light—shift your perspective, see God's truth, and stop catastrophizing.",
    teaching: `The holy place had no windows - the only light came from the golden lampstand. Without it, the priests ministered in darkness.

**Stress thrives in mental darkness. God kills stress with truth.**

The candlestick gives:
• Perspective
• Wisdom
• New thinking
• God's promises
• Reality vs fear
• Truth over imagination
• Illumination over confusion

Most stress comes from:
• Catastrophic thinking ("Everything will fall apart")
• Worst-case scenarios
• Distorted perception
• Lack of perspective
• Mental darkness

The lampstand represents **cognitive reframing** - seeing the same situation in God's light instead of fear's darkness.

**The Seven Branches of Illumination:**
1. **God's Sovereignty** - He's in control
2. **His Faithfulness** - He's never failed
3. **His Promises** - They cannot fail
4. **Eternal Perspective** - This is temporary
5. **Past Victories** - He's brought you through before
6. **His Presence** - You're not alone
7. **His Purpose** - There's meaning in this

    stressPrinciple: "Prayer is the atmosphere of calm that lowers anxiety and invites peace.",
    teaching: `The altar of incense was positioned right before the veil, its fragrance filling the entire holy place. Prayer creates an atmosphere that transforms stress.

**Here you:**
• Pray slowly
• Breathe deeply
• Release emotion
• Let God hold you
• Calm your nervous system
• Raise your atmosphere

**Incense = essential oils of Heaven.**
**Prayer = stress detox.**

Worship shifts the emotional environment of the heart. The fragrance of incense was constant - teaching that prayer should be continuous, not crisis-only.

**Prayer as Stress Regulation:**
• **Physiological**: Deep breathing activates parasympathetic nervous system
• **Psychological**: Shifts focus from problem to Provider
• **Spiritual**: Releases burdens to God
• **Emotional**: Creates space for processing feelings

The incense rose upward - teaching that your prayers don't fall to the ground. They reach God's throne.

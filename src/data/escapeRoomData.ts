      hint: "What began at the end of the 2300 days that fulfills the Day of Atonement type?",
      explanation: "Daniel's sealed prophecies reveal that in 1844, at the end of the 2300-day prophecy, Christ began a special work of judgment in the heavenly sanctuary - the antitypical Day of Atonement. This is the 'cleansing of the sanctuary' - not the earth, but the heavenly temple where Christ ministers. Just as the high priest entered the Most Holy Place once a year to cleanse the sanctuary, Christ entered the Most Holy Place of heaven to begin the investigative judgment before His return.",

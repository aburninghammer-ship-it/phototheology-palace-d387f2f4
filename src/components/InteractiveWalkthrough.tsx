    verseText: "The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want... I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.",
    principleExplanation: "The Story Room principle: Turn each biblical story into a vivid mental movie with a clear sequence. Don't just read — create a chain of images: scene 1 → scene 2 → scene 3. The stranger the images, the more memorable they become.",
    applicationToText: "Psalm 23's sequence: (1) Shepherd with staff → (2) Green meadow, still water → (3) Dark valley with shadow → (4) Banquet table with enemies watching → (5) Temple doors opening. Five scenes, one movie you can replay anytime.",

    principleExplanation: "The Imagination Room principle: Step INSIDE the text as if you were there. Engage all five senses — what do you see, hear, smell, feel, taste? This isn't fantasy; it's sanctified empathy that anchors memory in emotional experience.",
    applicationToText: "Immerse yourself in verse 2: Feel the soft grass beneath your back. Hear the quiet trickle of still water. Smell the fresh meadow air. Feel the sun warming your face. Sense the Shepherd sitting nearby, staff in hand, watching over you.",
    christConnection: "Christ offers living water (John 4:14) and calls the weary to rest in Him (Matt 11:28-29). When you lie down in this mental pasture, you're resting in Christ.",
    jeevesInsight: "The Hebrew 'still waters' literally means 'waters of rest.' Sheep won't drink from rushing streams — they fear drowning. Picture the Shepherd specifically finding a quiet pool for anxious souls. That's the image to carry.",

    verseText: "The LORD is my shepherd... I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.",
    principleExplanation: "The 24FPS principle: Create ONE symbolic image per chapter — like a movie is made of 24 frames per second, Scripture becomes a mental film strip. Each Psalm gets one strange, memorable anchor image that encodes its content.",
    applicationToText: "Psalm 23's frame: A shepherd's crook wrapped in a golden crown, dripping with oil, resting on a banquet table. This single bizarre image encodes: shepherd (crook), kingship (crown), anointing (oil), provision (table). One image = one psalm.",
    christConnection: "The shepherd-crook wrapped in a crown IS Christ — the humble Shepherd who is also the King of Kings.",
    jeevesInsight: "The stranger the image, the better it sticks. A normal shepherd holding a staff? Forgettable. A crook wrapped in a crown dripping oil on a table in a dark valley? That's Psalm 23 encoded forever.",

    verse: "Psalm 23:4",
    verseText: "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.",
    principleExplanation: "The Translation Room principle: Convert abstract words into concrete, visible images. When you read 'shadow of death,' don't leave it as words — translate it into a picture you can see. Words become scenes; phrases become paintings.",
    applicationToText: "Translate 'valley of the shadow of death': Picture a deep ravine with steep walls. The sun is blocked, casting everything in grey shadow. The shadow has a shape — it looks like a hooded figure, but it's only a shadow, not death itself. And ahead, a glowing figure walks, dispelling the shadow with each step.",
    christConnection: "Christ absorbed death's reality at Calvary so we only pass through its shadow. He walked through death itself; we walk through its mere silhouette.",
    jeevesInsight: "Notice: it's the SHADOW of death, not death itself. Shadows cannot harm — they only frighten. Your translation should show a scary shape that, when you look closely, has no substance. That's the point.",
    memoryHook: "See the shadow on the valley wall. It looks terrifying — until the Shepherd's light reveals it's just a shadow of something already defeated."

    principleExplanation: "The Gems Room principle: Store powerful insights that shine with unusual clarity. A gem is not just any fact — it's a striking discovery that changes how you see the text. Collect and preserve these 'aha!' moments for future teaching and meditation.",
    applicationToText: "Gem discovered: The Hebrew word for 'restoreth' is SHUB — the same word used for 'repentance' (turning back). When God restores your soul, He's doing FOR you what repentance asks you to do yourself — He's turning you back to Him.",
    christConnection: "Christ doesn't just heal — He returns us to Eden's original design. Restoration isn't repair; it's re-creation.",
    jeevesInsight: "This is a gem worth collecting: Repentance (SHUB) is something we do; restoration (SHUB) is what God does. Same Hebrew word, different direction. We turn to Him; He turns us back to ourselves as He made us.",
    memoryHook: "Picture a gemstone emerging from rough rock. This SHUB insight is a gem — polish it and it will shine in every sermon about restoration."

    verseText: "The LORD is my shepherd... I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.",
    principleExplanation: "The Observation Room principle: Write 30-50 observations about a passage BEFORE interpretation. Like a detective gathering evidence before theories, log every detail — names, numbers, actions, repetitions, sequences, contrasts — without rushing to meaning.",
    applicationToText: "Observations on Psalm 23: (1) Six verses. (2) 'LORD' appears twice. (3) Moves from 'He' statements to 'Thou' statements at verse 4 — from talking ABOUT God to talking TO God. (4) Settings shift: pasture → water → valley → table → temple. (5) Enemies appear only once, silently watching.",
    christConnection: "Observe: The psalm moves from third person ('He maketh me') to second person ('Thou art with me') exactly when danger arrives. In the valley, intimacy intensifies.",
    jeevesInsight: "Count the 'He' statements (what God does) versus 'I' statements (David's response). The psalm is 80% about God's action, 20% human response. Biblical faith is primarily receptive — that's an observation that shapes theology.",

    verse: "Psalm 23:5",
    verseText: "Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.",
    principleExplanation: "The Def-Com Room principle: Run words through the forensic lab — check Greek/Hebrew definitions and historical/cultural context. Commentaries are expert witnesses, not judges. The goal is precision: what did this word mean to the original audience?",
    applicationToText: "Lab results: 'Anointest' (Hebrew: dishanta) literally means 'to make fat, to enrich, to saturate.' It's not a light touch — it's being drenched in abundance. 'Runneth over' (Hebrew: revayah) means 'saturation, overflow.' The image is embarrassing excess.",
    christConnection: "Anointing (mashach) is the root of 'Messiah' — the Anointed One. David receives what Christ IS. The oil points to the Holy Spirit poured out without measure on Christ (John 3:34).",
    jeevesInsight: "Cultural context: In the ancient Near East, a host anointed guests as honor. An overflowing cup meant 'I cannot contain my generosity toward you.' God isn't being careful with His blessing — He's being extravagant.",
    memoryHook: "Picture oil being poured so generously it runs down your face. That's dishanta. Picture a cup being filled past the brim. That's revayah. Embarrassing excess."

    verse: "Psalm 23:5b",
    verseText: "My cup runneth over.",
    principleExplanation: "The Symbols/Types Room principle: Identify God's recurring imagery as prophetic pictures. Symbols (lamb, rock, water) carry consistent meaning across Scripture. Types are shadows of Christ — Old Testament persons, objects, or events that foreshadow the Messiah.",
    applicationToText: "Symbol identified: The 'cup' appears throughout Scripture — cup of blessing (Ps 116:13), cup of salvation, cup of wrath (Jer 25), cup of the New Covenant (Luke 22:20). David's overflowing cup points forward to Christ's cup at the Last Supper.",
    christConnection: "Jesus took the cup and said 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood.' David's cup of blessing anticipates the cup of redemption that would overflow to all nations.",
    jeevesInsight: "Track the 'cup' symbol across Scripture: blessing (Ps 23), salvation (Ps 116), wrath (Jer 25), and covenant (Luke 22). Same symbol, layers of meaning. Christ drank the cup of wrath so ours could overflow with blessing.",
    memoryHook: "See the cup in David's hand transform into the cup in Christ's hand at the Last Supper. Same symbol, ultimate fulfillment."

    verse: "Psalm 23:4",
    verseText: "I will fear no evil: for thou art with me.",
    principleExplanation: "The Questions Room principle: Ask 75 questions per passage across three levels — Intratextual (inside the text), Intertextual (across Scripture), and Phototheological (within the Palace framework). Interrogate until the story emerges.",
    applicationToText: "Sample questions: INTRATEXTUAL — Why 'fear NO evil' rather than 'face no evil'? Why does David switch from 'He' to 'Thou' exactly here? INTERTEXTUAL — Where else does God's presence remove fear? (Exodus 33, Isaiah 41:10) PHOTOTHEOLOGICAL — Which Palace rooms does 'Thou art with me' activate?",
    christConnection: "The answer to 'Why no fear?' is 'FOR thou art with me.' The presence of Christ is the antidote to fear — not the absence of evil, but the presence of the Shepherd.",
    jeevesInsight: "Key question: Does David say evil won't exist in the valley, or that he won't FEAR it? The text admits evil is real but strips its power through relationship. Presence conquers fear; presence doesn't eliminate danger.",

    verseText: "The LORD is my shepherd.",
    principleExplanation: "The Q&A Room principle: Let Scripture interpret Scripture. Cross-reference verses to answer questions — like witnesses corroborating testimony in court. If one verse asks a question, another verse answers it. Scripture is its own best commentary.",
    applicationToText: "Question: Who is the Shepherd? Answer from John 10:11 — 'I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.' Question: What does the Shepherd do? Answer from John 10:11 — He dies for His sheep. Psalm 23's Shepherd is identified in John 10.",
    christConnection: "Psalm 23 asks; John 10 answers. The entire Gospel of John chapter 10 is the New Testament commentary on Psalm 23. Cross-reference them and Christ emerges.",
    jeevesInsight: "The Q&A Room protects against private interpretation. When you ask 'Who is my shepherd?' and let John 10:11 answer, you're not inventing meaning — you're discovering it. Witnesses corroborate; truth emerges.",

    applicationToText: "Next time you see a meadow, a stream, or actual sheep, let it preach Psalm 23. The grass is real; the water is real; shepherds are real. Nature testifies to the Creator's care — and Psalm 23 is nature's vocabulary for describing divine providence.",

    question: "How does the 7-day free trial work?",
    answer: "Sign up and get full access to all Premium features for 7 days — no restrictions. After your trial, choose a plan that fits your needs. We believe you should experience the full value before deciding."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between the suite and the card deck/courses?",
    answer: "The Phototheology Bible Learning Suite is a standalone digital platform. The physical card deck and video courses are separate products that complement the suite but are not required. The suite contains the complete Palace method — you don't need anything else to master it."
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from YouVersion or Logos?",
    answer: "YouVersion is excellent for reading and plans. Logos is powerful for scholarly research. Phototheology is specifically designed for memory and mastery — turning Scripture into visual palaces you'll never forget. It's not a replacement; it's a complementary approach for those who want to truly internalize the Bible."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be tech-savvy to use this?",
    answer: "Not at all. The app is designed for all skill levels. Our guided tours and Jeeves AI assistant help you every step of the way. If you can use a smartphone, you can use Phototheology."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this a particular denomination's interpretation?",
    answer: "Phototheology teaches a Christ-centered, Bible-believing approach. While developed from an Adventist perspective, the Palace method and hermeneutical principles are applicable across Protestant traditions. We focus on what unites believers: Christ as the center of all Scripture."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel anytime?",
    answer: "Absolutely. No contracts, no hidden fees. Cancel your subscription anytime. During your trial, you can cancel with no charge. We don't believe in locking people in."
